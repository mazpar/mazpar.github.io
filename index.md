Hi, I am Parichay Mazumdar; a Pre Doctoral Researcher at Max-Planck Institute for Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany.
I'm currently working in sub-millimeter astronomy. My research focusses on the functioning of Giant Molecular Clouds 
(aka GMC, stellar nurseries); in particular understanding the role of feedback from giant OB stars on their parent GMC.
