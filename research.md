My research interests fall under two broad areas: understanding conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way,
and the process of galaxy evolution. Given below is a brief summary of different research projects I have done so far.

### Low-z damped Lyman-alpha systems
Damped Lyman &alpha systems (DLAs) are the highest HI column density systems detected in absorption in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra of background quasars (N(HI) > 2x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$). Even though they are presumed to be the high-_z_ counterparts of today’s normal galaxies their HI content is insufficient (by about a factor of 2) to entirely fuel the stars observed in today’s galaxies. But they still contain the bulk of the neutral hydrogen at high _z_ (~80%). Understanding the nature of the galaxies that give rise to DLAs and their redshift evolution has been an important question in galaxy evolution for nearly 30 years. We carried a deep search for redshifted HI 21cm emission from three DLAs and sub-DLAs at _z_~0.1 with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). No evidence for a redshifted HI 21cm emission signal was obtained in their GBT spectra. The non-detection of HI 21cm emission yielded strong constraints on the HI masses of the associated galaxies continuing the trend of low HI masses found in all low-_z_ DLAs and sub-DLAs that have been searched for redshifted HI 21cm emission.
