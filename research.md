My research interests fall under two broad areas: understanding conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way,
and the process of galaxy evolution. Given below is a brief summary of different research projects I have done so far.

## Low-_z_ damped Lyman &alpha systems
Damped Lyman &alpha systems (DLAs) are the highest HI column density systems detected in absorption in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra of background quasars (N$_{\rm{HI}} \geq 2 \times 10^{20} \si{\per\cm\squared}$). Even though they are presumed to be the high-$z$ counterparts of today’s normal galaxies their HI content is insufficient (by about a factor of 2) to entirely fuel the stars observed in today’s galaxies [\cit{Noterdaeme et al. 2009, A$\&$A, 505, 1087}]. But they still contain the bulk of the neutral hydrogen at high $z$ ($\approx$80\%). Understanding the nature of the galaxies that give rise to DLAs and their redshift evolution has been an important question in galaxy evolution for nearly 30 years. We carried a deep search for redshifted HI 21cm emission from three DLAs and sub-DLAs at $z\approx0.1$ with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) [\cit{Mazumdar et al. 2014, MNRAS, Vol. 443}]. No evidence for a redshifted HI 21cm emission signal was obtained in their GBT spectra. The non-detection of HI 21cm emission yielded strong constraints on the HI masses of the associated galaxies continuing the trend of low HI masses found in all low-$z$ DLAs and sub-DLAs that have been searched for redshifted HI 21cm emission.
